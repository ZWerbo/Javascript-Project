# Javascript-Project ~~~ PUKEMAN BB!!!!
        the plan? 
Background - 
PukeMan is being chases for no apparent reason. Chug a lugging around the board our hero will come across spoiled food. Giving him the ability to vomit uncontrollably(shooting pellets out the mouth) that eviserate the unlucky foes in his way. PukeMan is always full. PukeMan is healthy and is not hurt by any of this. 

The basics of the game will be a board where the user moves the character around. he will simply try to stay alive. 

Functionality and MVPs
With Pukeman the user will be able to
-Start the game 
-Use the keys to move the character around the board. 
-Have the game end when you run into something. 
The Project will also have the rules of the game(the goal)


Wireframes 
~Upon opening the game we will have a title, the game board in the middle.
    -the rules of the game will be on the left side(they will be simple)

-The page is going to be wild. 


Technologies, Libraries, APIs
-For this project ill probably use....
    -The Canvas API to make a board
    -The Webpack and babel bundle. 


Implementation Timeline 
~Friday Afternoon // Weekend~
  during this time I want to get the game board done, get the character moving on the board, and atleast get the enemies implemented also. 
  if i could also figure out how to render the food get it eaten that would be a cherry on top.

~Monday 
    hopefully I can figure out how to get PukeMan to shoot pellets on the board. 

~Tuesday 
    figure out how to implement some respawns for the enemy or maybe make multiple levels.

~Wednesday 
    determine how far I have gotten on the other parts and see what needs to be done. 
    Mess more with styling and adding flourishes I think would be cool(that hopefully don't break anything)


Bonus features? 
    It'll just get better and better.
